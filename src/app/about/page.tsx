          Rhythmos is an experiment in non-linear, intuitive forms of logging my personal self-healing practice. It’s a record of lived cycles – an experiment in observing the body, psyche, and cosmos as one system.
          I use it to study myself as both subject and witness, blending intuition with structure, and sharing what I learn so that others might recognize themselves in it too.

          I track things like mood, symptoms, practices, digestion, moon phase, and menstrual cycle.
          Threads are used to track specific journeys.

          In a time when research is underfunded, healthcare is inaccessible to many, 
          and personal data is constantly extracted without consent or compensation, I want to reclaim the act of documentation. 
          Publishing my self-studied health data and reflections is a gesture of transparency and autonomy. It’s an offering toward a more poetic, 
          less clinical approach to healing.

          This is an ongoing prototype – a living experiment.
